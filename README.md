### Context

I work with complex technical systems where **architecture, constraints and decision-making** matter more than frameworks.

My background sits between **engineering execution** and **strategic solution design**, often in environments where failure is not an option.

---

### What I actually do

- Design and validate complex solutions across multiple domains  
- Translate business and operational needs into technical architectures  
- Support high-stakes decisions involving risk, scale and trade-offs  
- Act as a technical counterpart for executives, engineers and partners  

This role is commonly labeled *Pre-Sales Engineering*, but in practice it is **systems thinking applied to real-world constraints**.

---

### Domains of experience

- Large-scale solution and systems architecture  
- Mission-critical platforms and communications  
- Networking, infrastructure and distributed systems  
- AI-enabled workflows and automation  
- Cross-functional technical leadership

### This repository

This is not a showcase.

It is a **working surface** containing:
- architectural explorations
- proofs of concept
- technical notes
- experiments with AI, tooling and systems
