### Profile

I operate at the intersection of **engineering, systems architecture and enterprise adoption**, supporting organizations where scale, security and reliability are non-negotiable.

My work spans **AI-enabled platforms**, **API-driven ecosystems** and **multi-cloud infrastructure**, with a strong focus on real-world constraints, integration patterns and value realization.

---

### What I actually work on

- Enterprise AI adoption and platform enablement  
- Solution and systems architecture across cloud and edge  
- API integration, authentication and platform security  
- Technical decision support for executives and engineering teams  
- Adoption strategy, enablement and measurable value realization  

---

### Domains of operation

- Applied Artificial Intelligence (LLMs, agents, RAG)  
- Multi-cloud and hybrid architectures  
- Edge computing and low-latency systems  
- Enterprise security and compliance  
- API-first platforms and integrations  
- Technical customer success at scale  

---

### Achievements (selected)

These are **outcomes**, not titles.

- Enabled **enterprise AI adoption** across regulated environments using Azure OpenAI, Google Cloud AI and API-first architectures  
- Supported **$1M+ expansion revenue** through technical advisory, platform enablement and adoption strategy  
- Achieved **95%+ retention** across large enterprise and government accounts in high-stakes environments  
- Designed and validated **AI-ready, low-latency architectures** for edge and distributed systems  
- Led **100+ technical workshops and enablement sessions** for engineers, architects and executives  
- Acted as technical counterpart in **C-level decision-making** involving risk, compliance and scale

### This repository

This is not a portfolio.

It is a **technical surface** containing:
- architectural explorations  
- proofs of concept  
- AI experiments and integrations  
- reference implementations  
- technical notes

## AI Adoption Playbooks

These repositories document **practical decision frameworks, integration patterns and lessons learned**
from adopting Artificial Intelligence in real-world enterprise environments.

- **[Enterprise AI Adoption Playbook](https://github.com/fabricioartur/enterprise-ai-adoption-playbook)**  
  Decision frameworks for adopting AI under organizational, architectural and regulatory constraints.

- **[LLM Integration Patterns](https://github.com/fabricioartur/llm-integration-patterns)**  
  Proven patterns for integrating LLMs into existing systems, APIs and workflows.

- **[AI Failures and Lessons Learned](https://github.com/fabricioartur/ai-failures-and-lessons)**  
  Recurring failure modes observed during AI adoption initiatives, anonymized and distilled.
